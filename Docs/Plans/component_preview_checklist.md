# UI Component Preview Checklist

This document is for tracking the testing of each UI component's live preview functionality in the "Screens" stage of the game creator.

## Instructions

1.  For each component, drag it into a view in the "Screens" stage.
2.  Click the "Preview" button for that view.
3.  Mark the component as "Working" or "Failing".
4.  If it fails, add a brief note about the error message or unexpected behavior.
