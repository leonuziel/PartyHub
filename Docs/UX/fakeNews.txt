Here is a detailed UI/UX design for FakeNews, broken down by each distinct phase of the game.
Guiding Principles for FakeNews UI
Mischievous Theme: The color palette might shift to something more playful and deceptive, like deep purples, golds, and electric blues. The typography could be a bit more stylized than QuizClash's straightforward look.
Clarity is Paramount: With multiple layers of deception, the UI must be crystal clear about what the player needs to do at each stage.
The Reveal is Everything: The design will build tension, leading to a multi-stage reveal that maximizes laughter and "I knew it!" moments.
1. STARTING State
This state is kept consistent with QuizClash to maintain a cohesive app experience.
Host View (Large Screen): A "Get Ready!" message, followed by a dramatic 3... 2... 1... countdown. The game's title, "FakeNews," is displayed with a fun, perhaps newspaper-inspired logo.
Player View (Phone): A simple "Get Ready!" screen showing the player's avatar and nickname, with the crucial instruction: "Look at the main screen for the prompt!"
2. WRITING_FAKES State
Objective: Give players a clear prompt and an easy way to secretly write their most convincing lie.
Host View (Large Screen)
This screen sets the stage and builds social pressure.
The Prompt: The question is displayed prominently with a large, clear blank space (e.g., "The original name for Google was actually ________.").
Player Status Grid: The main area of the screen shows a grid of all player avatars. As a player submits their fake answer, their avatar gets a green checkmark or a "Submitted!" banner. This creates a fun sense of urgency for those who are still writing.
Timer: A countdown timer ensures the game keeps moving.

Player View (Phone)
This is the player's private "lie-writing" canvas.
Prompt Reminder: The question is repeated at the top of the screen for easy reference.
Text Input: A large, clean text input field is the primary focus, with a blinking cursor prompting them to type. A character limit (e.g., 60 characters) is displayed to keep answers concise.
Submit Button: A large, clear button that says "Submit Your Fake".
After Submission: Once the player submits, the input field is replaced with a confirmation message: "Lie submitted! Now, look innocent..."

3. VOTING_PHASE State
Objective: Display all the lies (and the one truth) anonymously and let players vote for what they think is real.
Host View (Large Screen)
The Options: All the player-submitted fake answers and the single correct answer are displayed in a randomized, numbered list. The design is clean and uniform to give no clues away.
"Who to Believe?": A headline like "One of these is TRUE. The rest are FAKE NEWS." sets the tone.
Timer: A prominent timer rushes the players' decisions.

Player View (Phone)
Tappable List: The phone screen mirrors the list of answers shown on the host screen, but each one is a large, tappable button.
Disabling Self-Vote: The player's own submitted lie is greyed out and disabled, with a small label saying "Your Lie". This prevents them from voting for themselves.
After Voting: When a player taps their choice, it's highlighted, and all other options are disabled. The screen updates with: "Vote locked in! Let's see who you fooled..."

4. REVEALING_RESULTS State
This is the dramatic, multi-step payoff. It happens in a sequence on the host screen.
Host View (Large Screen)
Vote Tally: Small player avatars fly in and land next to the answer each person voted for. This creates the first wave of groans and laughter.
The TRUTH Reveal: All fake answers fade to grey. The one correct answer is highlighted brilliantly (e.g., in gold) with a "TRUTH!" stamp. A satisfying "ding!" sound plays.
The LIARS Reveal: Now, for each fake answer, the author's name and avatar fade in next to it. This is the biggest reveal, connecting the lies to the liars.
Points Breakdown: A final animation shows points flying to the players.
"+1000" appears for everyone who guessed the truth.
Crucially, "Fooling Points!" appear above the liars' names, showing how many people they tricked and the bonus points they earned.

Player View (Phone)
This screen provides a personalized summary of their performance in the round.
Personal Outcome: A large message declares their result: "You found the TRUTH!" or "You got FOOLED!".
Fooling Score: A dedicated section shows how their lie performed: "Your lie fooled 3 players! +1500 Fooling Points". This is the most important feedback for many players.
Score Update: Their new total score and rank are clearly displayed.

5. FINISHED State
Objective: Celebrate the winner and highlight the most interesting social outcomes of the game.
Host View (Large Screen)
Winners' Podium: The standard 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place podium is shown with celebratory confetti and music.
Special Awards (The "Interesting Statistics"): After the podium, a series of fun, full-screen awards are presented:
MASTER LIAR: Awarded to the player who fooled the most people throughout the game.
TRUTH SEEKER: Awarded to the player who guessed the correct answer most often.
MOST GULLIBLE: A humorous "award" for the player who fell for the most fake answers.
Final Leaderboard & "Play Again" Button: The final scores are shown, along with the call to action for the host.
