Here is a detailed UI/UX design for War, focusing on amplifying the high moments and making the core loop fast and satisfying.
Guiding Principles for War UI
Create Drama: Since the game is 100% luck, the interface must manufacture the excitement. This means big animations, impactful sound effects, and a visual theme centered around a "battle" or a high-stakes face-off.
Speed and Satisfaction: The core loop of playing a card should be quick and feel impactful. The UI should not bog the player down with unnecessary steps.
Clarity of Score: The "score" in War is the player's card count. This number must be visible and clear at all times.
1. STARTING State
This state remains consistent with the established PartyHub pre-game flow.
Host View (Large Screen): "Get Ready!" message, followed by a 3... 2... 1... countdown. The "War" logo might have a bold, confrontational style. A thematic animation could show a deck of 52 cards being split and flying to opposite sides of the screen.
Player View (Phone): A "Get Ready!" screen showing the player's avatar and nickname, with the instruction: "The battle is about to begin!"
2. ROUND_IN_PROGRESS State
Objective: Create a fast, clear, and satisfying loop for the core gameplay mechanic.
Host View (Large Screen)
The layout is a classic top-vs-bottom battlefield.
Player Zones: The top third of the screen is for Player 1 (the "opponent") and the bottom third is for Player 2 (the "host" or another player). Each zone contains:
The player's Nickname and Avatar.
A large, clear Card Count, which serves as their score.
The Battlefield (Center Area): This is where the action happens.
The Play: When players tap their phones, a card animates from their respective zone, flying into a central "played card" slot. It lands face down, then flips over with a satisfying thwack sound effect.
The Judgment: After both cards are revealed, the higher-ranking card briefly glows or grows larger. The lower-ranking card dims.
The Spoils: A banner appears ("Player 1 Wins!"). An animation then shows both cards from the center flying over to the winner's Card Count, which ticks up by two. The round resolves in seconds.

Player View (Phone)
This is the player's action button. It must be simple and inviting.
The Deck: The screen is dominated by a single, large, tappable graphic representing the player's face-down deck.
The Call to Action: A simple prompt like "Tap to Play Your Card" is displayed. The deck itself might have a subtle glow to indicate it's ready.
Feedback:
Upon tapping, the card on the phone animates as if it's flying "into" the main screen.
The deck button then becomes greyed out and inactive, and a status message appears: "Waiting for opponent..." This prevents multi-tapping and clearly communicates the player has completed their action for the round.

3. WAR_DECLARED State
Objective: Make the tie-breaker the most dramatic and exciting moment of the game.
Host View (Large Screen)
This is a multi-stage, high-impact sequence that interrupts the normal flow.
The Trigger: Two identical cards are on the battlefield.
The Declaration: The game pauses. The screen flashes. A massive, stylized "W A R !" banner animates across the screen with a booming sound effect.
Placing the Stakes: An animation shows three cards flying out from each player's deck and landing face-down on the battlefield. The on-screen Card Counts visibly decrease by 4 for each player, showing the high cost of this battle.
The Final Showdown: The prompt changes to "Play Your Final Card to Win the War!" When players tap, a final face-up card is played. The winner of this final card wins the entire pot of 10 cards. The animation for these 10 cards flying to the winner's count is extra large and celebratory.

Player View (Phone)
The player's phone reflects the drama of the host screen.
The Alert: The screen flashes, and a large "WAR!" message appears, confirming the tie.
The Prompt: After the face-down cards are automatically placed on the host screen, the player's deck on their phone becomes active again, glowing more intensely. The prompt changes to "Tap to Play Your War Card!". The interaction is the same as a normal round, but the stakes feel infinitely higher.

4. FINISHED State
Objective: Clearly declare the victor and provide some fun, luck-based statistics.
Host View (Large Screen)
Victory Screen: A large "VICTORY!" screen is shown, with the winner's avatar and nickname displayed prominently. Since it's a two-player game, a simple "Winner" and "Loser" designation is clear.
Celebration: Thematic animations like raining cards or a crown appearing on the winner's avatar.
Fun Statistics ("Tales from the War"):
Total Wars Fought: How many times the players tied.
Biggest Pot Won: Highlights the player who won the most cards in a single War.
Luckiest Turn: Shows the highest-value card that won a round (e.g., "An Ace of Spades!").
Call to Action: A clear "Play Again" button for the host.

Player View (Phone)
Personal Result: A clear, full-screen message: "You Win!" or "You Lose!".
Final Score: Shows their final card count vs. the opponent's.
Re-engagement Buttons:
"Rematch!"
"Back to Lobby"
