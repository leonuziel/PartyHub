# Game Configuration Specification

This document outlines the specification for the JSON-based game configuration files used by the `ConfigurableGame` engine.

## 1. Overview

The backend features a dynamic game engine, `ConfigurableGame.ts`, capable of running games defined entirely by a JSON structure. This allows for rapid development and iteration of new games without writing custom game logic in TypeScript for each one.

The system is designed around a state machine concept. The game's flow is determined by a series of `states`, `events`, reusable `actions`, and `transitions`.

## 2. Configuration Schema

A game configuration is a single JSON object. The sections below describe each of the top-level keys, their purpose, and how they are used by the game engine.

### General Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "gameData": {},
  "initialState": "",
  "initialGameState": {},
  "playerAttributes": {},
  "actions": {},
  "states": {},
  "events": {},
  "transitions": [],
  "ui": {}
}

```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "gameId": "quizclash",
    "title": "QuizClash (Config)",
    "description": "A dynamically configured trivia game.",
    "minPlayers": 1,
    "maxPlayers": 8

          "Au",
          "Ag",
          "Go",

### `metadata`

**(Object)** Defines basic, static information about the game. This is used for display in lobbies and for setting game rules.

*   `gameId` (string): A unique identifier for the game (e.g., "quizclash").
*   `title` (string): The display name of the game.
*   `description` (string): A brief description of what the game is about.
*   `minPlayers` (number): The minimum number of players required to start.
*   `maxPlayers` (number): The maximum number of players allowed in a room.

**Example:**
```json
"metadata": {
  "gameId": "quizclash",
  "title": "QuizClash",
  "description": "A dynamically configured trivia game.",
  "minPlayers": 1,
  "maxPlayers": 8
}
```

### `gameData`

**(Object)** Contains any static data the game needs to run. This data is loaded once when the game starts and is not expected to change during gameplay. It's a useful place to store things like questions, card definitions, or level layouts.

**Example:**
```json
"gameData": {
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
      "correctAnswer": "Au",
      "options": ["Au", "Ag", "Go", "Gd"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### State Initialization

The game engine initializes its state from three top-level keys:

*   **`initialState` (String)**: The name of the first state the game enters when it starts (e.g., `"STARTING"`). This must match one of the keys in the `states` object.
*   **`initialGameState` (Object)**: Defines the starting values for the game's dynamic, shared state. This object tracks all information that changes as the game progresses.
*   **`playerAttributes` (Object)**: Defines a template for each player's state. When a player joins, they are assigned their own copy of this object.

**Example:**
```json
"initialState": "STARTING",

"initialGameState": {
  "currentQuestionIndex": -1,
  "currentQuestion": null,
  "winner": null
},

"playerAttributes": {
  "score": 0,
  "currentAnswer": null
}
```

### Game Logic: Effects and Actions

The logic of the game is driven by **effects** and **actions**.

*   An **Effect** is a single operation to be performed by the game engine. An effect can be one of three things:
    1.  A call to a built-in `function` (e.g., `setProperty`, `startTimer`).
    2.  A `runAction` command, which executes a named action.
    3.  A `forEachPlayer` loop, which runs a list of effects for every player.

*   An **Action** is a reusable sequence of effects, defined in the top-level `actions` object. This is the key to avoiding duplicated logic.

Anywhere you can define a list of effects (e.g., in an `onEnter` block or an `event`), you can mix and match these types.

**Example:**
```json
"actions": {
  "awardPointsAndResetAnswer": [
    {
      "condition": "{{player.currentAnswer === gameState.currentQuestion.correctAnswer}}",
      "function": "incrementProperty",
      "args": ["playerAttributes.{{player.id}}.score", 10]
    },
    {
      "function": "setProperty",
      "args": ["playerAttributes.{{player.id}}.currentAnswer", null]
    }
  ]
},
"states": {
  "REVEAL_ANSWER": {
    "onEnter": [
      { "function": "startTimer", "args": [5] },
      { "forEachPlayer": { "effects": [ { "runAction": "awardPointsAndResetAnswer" } ] } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### State Machine

The core of the game is a state machine defined by `states`, `events`, and `transitions`.

*   **`states` (Object)**: Defines all possible states the game can be in. Each state can have an `onEnter` block, which lists effects to be executed automatically whenever the game transitions *into* that state.
*   **`events` (Object)**: Defines the triggers that can be initiated by players, the host, or the server. Each event specifies `permissions` and an optional list of `effects`.
*   **`transitions` (Array)**: Defines the game's flow. It's a list of rules that tell the engine how to move from one state to another (`from`, `to`) in response to an `event`. Transitions can have an optional `condition` that must be met.

A powerful feature of the engine is its ability to resolve template strings like `{{ gameState.currentQuestionIndex }}` at runtime. This allows effects, actions, and conditions to be driven by dynamic game state.

### `ui`

**(Object)** The `ui` section defines the user interface for each state, separated by role (`host` and `player`). The backend uses this section to tell the frontend what to render.

*   The layout is defined as an array of `components`.
*   Each object specifies the `component` name (which must exist on the frontend) and its `props`.
*   The `props` are resolved on the backend using the same templating mechanism, injecting real-time game state into the UI definition before it's sent to the client.

**Example:**
```json
"ui": {
  "STARTING": {
    "host": [
      {
        "component": "CountdownTimer",
        "props": { "initialValue": 3 }
      }
    ],
    "player": [
      {
        "component": "CenteredMessage",
        "props": { "children": "The game is about to begin!" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 3. Configuration Loading

-   **`GameFactory.ts`**: This is the entry point for creating a new game. It checks for a `[gameId].json` file in the `Server/src/game/configurations/` directory.
-   **Dynamic Instantiation**: If a JSON file is found, the factory instantiates `ConfigurableGame`, passing the parsed JSON into its constructor.
-   **Legacy Fallback**: If no configuration file is found, the system falls back to instantiating a hard-coded game class (e.g., `QuizClashGame`).

## 4. Configuration Validation

-   **`GameConfigValidator.ts`**: To ensure the stability of the `ConfigurableGame` engine, all configurations are validated against a comprehensive schema upon being loaded.
-   **Zod Schema**: This file uses the `zod` library to define a strict schema (`gameConfigurationSchema`) that covers every aspect of the game configuration, from metadata to the props of every single UI component.
-   **Error Handling**: If a configuration fails validation, `ConfigurableGame` throws an error and refuses to start, preventing crashes from malformed JSON. The errors are logged to the console for debugging.

## 5. Obvious Missing Capabilities & Future Improvements

While the current system is powerful, there are several clear areas for improvement:

1.  **Limited `effects` Functions**: The list of available functions (`setProperty`, `incrementProperty`, `startTimer`, `calculateWinner`) is very small. To create more complex games, this needs to be expanded. Examples include:
    -   Array manipulation (`push`, `pop`, `filter`).
    -   More complex data manipulation (`max`, `min`, `sort`).
    -   String manipulation?.
    -   Saving player-specific input more robustly.

2.  **Lack of Complex Conditions**: The `condition` field in transitions is powerful but limited to single expressions. There's no way to define a reusable function or a more complex block of logic.

3.  **No "For Each Player" Logic in Transitions**: While `onEnter` and `effects` blocks can iterate over players using a `forEachPlayer` directive, this logic isn't available for `transitions` directly. This makes it hard to perform player-specific state changes as a condition for a transition.

4.  **Static `gameData`**: The `gameData` (e.g., the list of questions) is loaded once at the start of the game. There is no built-in mechanism to fetch or modify this data dynamically during gameplay (e.g., loading questions from an external API or a database).

5.  **Player-to-Player Interaction**: The action system is primarily designed for player-to-server interaction. There is no direct way for one player's action to target another player specifically.

6.  **Error Handling for Expressions**: The `resolveValue` function uses `try...catch` blocks, but errors are simply logged. A more robust system might invalidate the action or transition, or even expose the error to the host for debugging.
