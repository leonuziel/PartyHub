# PartyHub: Google Cloud Sales Meeting Summary

**Objective:** To translate our technical roadmap into a cost model narrative, demonstrating the critical role of Google Cloud credits in de-risking our growth and funding key strategic initiatives.

## The "Crawl, Walk, Run" Strategy

Our adoption of Google Cloud is planned in two distinct phases. We need credits to manage costs, de-risk critical transitions, and invest in the high-value features that will define our success.

### Phase 1: Alpha to Launch (Crawl & Walk)

This phase is about establishing a stable, scalable foundation while managing unpredictable initial costs.

**1. Core Application (Cloud Run):**
*   **Strategy:** Use Cloud Run for its efficient, pay-as-you-go model.
*   **Ask for Credits:** Credits will allow us to stress-test our application with real-world traffic spikes (e.g., "Game Nights") to establish a baseline cost-per-user without the risk of unexpected bills.

**2. Real-Time Infrastructure (Cloud Run → GKE):**
*   **Strategy:** This is our most significant technical and financial risk. We plan to start with WebSockets on Cloud Run but anticipate a necessary migration to GKE for scalability and reliability.
*   **The Challenge:**
    *   **Cloud Run:** WebSocket billing is based on connection duration, making costs for our long-running games highly unpredictable.
    *   **GKE:** Represents a substantial increase in our fixed monthly costs as we move from serverless to provisioned 24/7 nodes.
*   **Ask for Credits:**
    *   **De-risk the Unknown:** We need credits to benchmark the unpredictable WebSocket costs on Cloud Run.
    *   **Fund the Transition:** Credits are crucial to bridge the migration to GKE. They will allow us to build, test, and move to the new infrastructure without bearing the cost of two parallel systems.

**3. Storage (Cloud Storage & Firestore):**
*   **Strategy:** Use Cloud Storage for cheap and simple file storage, and Firestore for our community game gallery.
*   **Ask for Credits:** Firestore costs scale with user engagement (reads/writes). Credits will help us foster a vibrant community from day one without worrying about these "costs of success" before we begin monetization.

### Phase 2: Growth & Differentiation (Run)

This phase is about investing in the high-value, high-cost services that will be our key competitive advantages. This is our justification for a higher credit tier.

**1. AI-Assisted Game Creation (Vertex AI - Gemini API):**
*   **Strategy:** This is our "moonshot" feature and our single biggest differentiator. It's also our most expensive and variable cost.
*   **Ask for Credits:** This is a pure R&D initiative. We cannot build and test this feature at scale without significant credits. This is a direct investment in building our core competitive advantage on Google's most advanced platform.

**2. UGC Moderation (Vision & Natural Language APIs):**
*   **Strategy:** As a community-driven platform, automated moderation is a non-negotiable "cost of doing business" to ensure brand safety.
*   **Ask for Credits:** These services are our automated moderation team and another "cost of success" that scales directly with user-generated content. Credits will allow us to provide a safe platform from the start, which is critical for building user trust.

**3. Analytics (BigQuery & Looker Studio):**
*   **Strategy:** This is our "business brain," essential for finding product-market fit. In the early stages, we will be running numerous exploratory queries to understand user behavior.
*   **Ask for Credits:** Credits will allow us to ask the questions we need to find product-market fit without worrying that every query is a direct cost.

**4. Developer Productivity (Gemini for Google Cloud):**
*   **Strategy:** As a small team, developer velocity is our most valuable asset. Empowering our developers with AI-powered tools is a direct investment in our ability to iterate and innovate quickly.
*   **Ask for Credits:** Access to Gemini for Google Cloud allows our team to build faster, debug more efficiently, and ship more features. This is a crucial force multiplier that lets us compete with larger teams.

## Summary of Our "Ask"

We are seeking credits to:

1.  **De-risk Technical Unknowns:** Specifically, the unpredictable cost of WebSockets on Cloud Run.
2.  **Fund Key Transitions:** Bridge the significant cost increase of migrating from a serverless (Cloud Run) to a provisioned (GKE) architecture for our real-time services.
3.  **Invest in "Moonshot" Differentiators:** Fund the R&D for our core competitive advantage—AI Game Creation with Vertex AI.
4.  **Cover "Costs of Success":** Absorb the costs of high user engagement (Firestore, Vision API, BigQuery) until our revenue can support them.
5.  **Boost Developer Velocity:** Equip our small team with force-multiplying tools like Gemini for Google Cloud to accelerate our time-to-market.

By strategically applying credits, we can confidently build a high-growth, scalable business on the Google Cloud platform.
